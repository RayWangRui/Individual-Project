üëπ Tips‚ùïÔºöThe file of the game project Retroaction is too large, so I uploaded the Unity code of 
key parts to GitHub.<br>
I have uploaded the complete game project folder to Google Drive. Please browse the 
complete project code on Google Drive.

INTROCTION:<br>
=
Retroaction is an immersive interactive somatosensory game with Sensor Control in Physical Environment. This project is based on the Unity 3D engine, Arduino series boards and sensors, and Maya. Players can control the game character through interaction with the sensor, Specifically, they can control the character‚Äôs view and movement by Rotating and Tilting the sensor in a head model. Or talking to the animal through the microphone sensor at the back of the head model. Then the player will have a more immersive experience.

DESIGN PROCESS

Game Concept:<br>
The concept of the game originated from The Chinese traditional Confucian culture Tao Te Ching. which puts forward ‚Äú‰∏á‰∫ãÁöÜÊúâÂõ†Êûú‚Ä¢ Ë®ÄË°åÂêàÈÅìÊñπ‰∏∫Êô∫ËÄÖ‚Äù which means "Everything has a cause and effect.‚Äù In the game, players can understand it as "how you treat the world, the world will treat you in the same way.‚Äù Although this concept is widely mentioned, most of the relative work expresses it in a traditional way. But I think this concept is ageless. So the visual atmosphere I designed is dominated by grotesque aesthetics, I want to break the traditional stereotype by constructing a dreamy, grotesque, and exaggerated future world. 

Game prototyping (game mechanics)<br>

Through in-depth analysis of the game concept, our design appeal is immersion and exploration of the future world. Therefore, the number of players is 1, reducing the interference factors of multiple player interactions in the immersive experience.

GoalsÔºö
The goals of the game are to Find the exit of the world and explore the world by talking to the game object.

Actions: 
The actions of the game are moving the character and talking to the animals or plants through the sensors.

Rules:
The rule is don‚Äôt drop into the ocean, or you will die.


Object:
The key objects are molding in Maya, and I will express some design meaning<br>
human face Flower: the emotions of plants can be seen through facial expressions like human beings, every life is worth cherishing.<br>
A flamingo in fashionable shoes: a metaphor where animals and humans get along naturally. Animals can also have fashion.<br>
A male pregnant robot:which is a metaphor for equality between men and women in the future world.<br>

The way players control the game is different from traditional somatosensory games. This game does not operate the game through keyboards and handles but is replaced by sensors. In order to allow players to feel more immersive when playing the game, the author extracted key symbols from the core concept, made a plastic model in the real world, and installed sensors in it, the physical model is the same as the model in the Unity3D engine, which creates a corresponding relationship, allowing players to better bring their identity and role into the worldview created by the game. 
This key element is a robot that breeds life. Players can see the human head in the transparent belly of the robot as soon as they enter the digital world. The sensors that control the character's actions are in the same elements.  The player directly controls the movement of the character in the world through the transformation of the head angle and can communicate with the animals and plants in the game world through the microphone sensor on the back of the head.

Content interaction:


 At first, players will get game tasks and operation guides, and then enter the scene of practicing operations: heaven. In this scene, they can Practice how to control their movement. The player starts the game at the entrance with the initial state which expresses by the pure gray color of the character, then players can follow the guideline to explore the world. The world is divided into four parts. the natural world, desert, future city, and old cities. Considering the simple user experience, each area has a portal through which players can directly enter different areas.In this world, players can talk to the animals through a microphone sensor, the voice can trigger the player‚Äôs behavior, the behavior is divided into 2 categories, NO.1 is kindness, No.2 is malicious. When the decibel was detected value from 300-800, it will trigger kind behavior like touching gently, then the color of the character will change from white to green, which is the mark from this world. When the decibel is more than 800, it will trigger malicious behavior like kicking, then the body will gradually turn from black to red. When they find the world exit, they will obtain a color imprint from this world.

 The overall visual atmosphere of the game is dominated by grotesque aesthetics, and the cyborg scene and future city are constructed with dreams, grotesques, and genetic recombination as the core. The color matching is diversified, mainly contrasting and contrasting colors, creating a sense of visual impact. The following describes the design of scenes and elements in detail.


Scene design:

The game creates a future world, so the land, sea, and sky are built vertically. Horizontally, the land is surrounded by the ocean, and the land is divided into four plates: the natural world (flowers, plants, rocks, etc.), desert (desert and dry wasteland), future city (tall new technological buildings and urban landscapes) and dilapidated cities (street systems of small old houses). After all, a world is composed of a natural environment and a human environment, so the land must reflect natural civilization and human civilization. The natural world and the desert wasteland represent the prosperity and decline of nature respectively. Similarly, the future city and the dilapidated city also represent the reproduction and renewal of literary civilization. It can be said that natural selection and survival of the fittest. These plates are linked by stone roads, highways, and bridges, and each plate can also be linked by a conveyor door.


Element Design:

A pregnant robot with a male feature floating in the sky (with a human head inside a transparent belly): a male robot is pregnant, which is a metaphor for equality between men and women in the future world, and there will be no unfair treatment due to reproductive problems.
Flowers with human faces: the emotions of plants can be seen through facial expressions like human beings, everything has spirituality, and every life is worth cherishing. 
A flamingo wearing fashionable shoes as tall as a building: a metaphor for the future world where animals and humans get along naturally. Animals can also have fashion. Being as tall as a building means that one day we may become pets of animals, and it reminds people to treat animals well.

Due to the immersive feature of the design, our operating equipment cannot have a line link, so we use the ESP32, which has Wifi and Bluetooth wireless data transmission functions; the player movement function uses BNO005 Absolute Orientation Sensor, which can obtain the player's control direction and Angle data; the dialogue communication function uses the KY-038 microphone sensor, which can obtain the decibels of the player's voice.  I use Ardity plug-in to transform the data from Arduino IED to Unity engine. Then, connect the serial port data to the corresponding object in the game.¬†
