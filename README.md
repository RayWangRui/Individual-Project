## RETROACTION - Individual Project 🦩
UAL Msc Creative Computing Graduation Design Project

👹 Tips❕：The file of the game project Retroaction is too large, so I uploaded the Unity code of 
key parts to GitHub.<br>
I have uploaded the complete game project folder to Google Drive. Please browse the 
complete project code on Google Drive.

Introduction:<br>
Retroaction is an immersive interactive somatosensory game with Sensor Control in Physical Environment. This project is based on the Unity 3D engine, Arduino series boards and sensors, and Maya. Players can control the game character through interaction with the sensor, Specifically, they can control the character’s view and movement by Rotating and Tilting the sensor in a head model. Or talking to the animal through the microphone sensor at the back of the head model. Then the player will have a more immersive experience.

Game Concept 
The concept of the game originated from The Chinese traditional Confucian culture Tao Te Ching. which puts forward “万事皆有因果• 言行合道方为智者” which means "Everything has a cause and effect.” In the game, players can understand it as "how you treat the world, the world will treat you in the same way.” Although this concept is widely mentioned, most of the relative work expresses it in a traditional way. But I think this concept is ageless. So the visual atmosphere I designed is dominated by grotesque aesthetics, I want to break the traditional stereotype by constructing a dreamy, grotesque, and exaggerated future world.
