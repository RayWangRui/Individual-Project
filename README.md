👹 Tips❕：The file of the game project Retroaction is too large, so I uploaded the Unity code of

I have uploaded the complete game project folder to Google Drive. Please browse the

Retroaction is an immersive interactive somatosensory game with Sensor Control in Physical Environment. This project is based on the Unity 3D engine, Arduino series boards and sensors, and Maya. Players can control the game character through interaction with the sensor, Specifically, they can control the character’s view and movement by Rotating and Tilting the sensor in a head model. Or talking to the animal through the microphone sensor at the back of the head model. Then the player will have a more immersive experience.
